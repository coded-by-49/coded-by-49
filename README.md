print(" Hi there, I'm Henryaloh Fabian Bernard ")

This page is a journey. I am learner and one that is a road to mastery of Data sturctures and algorithms, backend engineering and machine Learning. I hope to inspire others who hunger for computer science like myself!

I am currently learning :
- Data sturcures and algorithms with python
- Machine Learning (via Google colab)
- Backend development with python (Django)

Why the combination ?
Well, because these are topics that feel me with excitement. From increasing the effciency of my model via the web through bending data structures to my own imaginations and ideas, learing how computers can understand and communicate with humans is somtehing that enthrals me and if am being honest, it should to whoever is reading this. I hope to share my knowledge and journey and this is my starting point.

I use DSA to :
- To sharpen my thinking process as a programmer
- To write more efficient machine learning code
- To build cleaner backend system


These are some of my current learnign projects i started a sometime a go
